# KDE Plasma Network Speed Widget
This is a clone of the default **Network Speed** widget that comes installed with **KDE Plasma Version 5.22.3**

This repository is for adding and testing modifications to the widget, such as adding the ability to show Download / Upload rates in bits (b/s, Kib/s and Mib/s).

Currently, the widget only shows rates in bytes (B/s, KiB/s and MiB/s).
